# MSCI-641-CourseProject-Chatbots

In this Project three different Chat Bot models (Seq2Seq LSTM model, Seq2Seq LSTM model with Attention mechanism, and the Transformer model) are built 

and the performance of them is compared using the Bleu score and human judgement metrics to offer best suggestion.

This project is done using Python.

PDF file is the project report and Python files are the project models.

The dataset is extracted from ‘https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html’. 

This corpus contains 220,579 conversations from raw movie scripts exchanged between 10,292 pairs of movie characters,
